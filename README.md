## Brick Breaker
**Brick Breaker** is a simple game that the player smash the wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle.</br>
The paddle move horizontally and is controlled with the right/left arrow keys on the key board. In addition, the length of paddle may get shorter.</br>
When the player breaks the half number of bricks, the speed of ball gets faster.</br>
Yellow bricks have double points of green bricks.</br>
When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player win. Otherwise, the player lose and game is over.</br>
The player can play again by pressing the enter key.
